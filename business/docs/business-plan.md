# ToneType Business Plan

## Executive Summary

ToneType is a mobile keyboard application that uses AI to detect emotional tone in text messages and enhance them with appropriate emojis and Unicode styling. The product addresses a universal pain point: text-based communication lacks tonal context, leading to misinterpretation and conflict.

**Market Opportunity**: 2.5B+ smartphone users globally, with messaging being the primary communication method. No dominant player exists in tone-aware keyboards.

**Revenue Model**: Freemium with API usage tiers

**Target Launch**: iOS (Q1 2026), Android (Q2 2026)

---

## Problem Statement

### The Communication Gap
- Text messages convey content but not tone
- 55% of emotional meaning comes from nonverbal cues (absent in text)
- Studies show up to 50% of emotional intent is misinterpreted in text
- This causes relationship friction, workplace conflicts, and social anxiety

### Current Solutions Fall Short
- Standard keyboards: No tone awareness
- Emoji keyboards: Manual selection, still requires interpretation
- Tone indicators (/s, /j): Niche, break flow, not widely adopted

### The Cost of Miscommunication
- Damaged relationships
- Workplace productivity loss
- Anxiety about how messages are perceived
- Time spent clarifying or apologizing

---

## Solution

ToneType is a keyboard replacement that:

1. **Detects Tone**: AI analyzes emotional context of typed text
2. **Suggests Emojis**: Context-appropriate emoji suggestions
3. **Applies Styling**: Unicode text formatting for emphasis
4. **Works Everywhere**: Functions in any app accepting text input

### Key Differentiators
- **AI-Determined Emphasis**: Not keyword matching; actual contextual understanding
- **Single-Tap Enhancement**: Minimal friction
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works in native Messages, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.
- **Privacy-First**: No logging, no storage, on-demand processing only
