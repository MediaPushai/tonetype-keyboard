# ToneType Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 30, 2026**

## Introduction

ToneType ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our ToneType keyboard application.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **API Key**: If you choose to use your own OpenAI API key, it is stored locally on your device in encrypted storage.
- **Settings Preferences**: Your customization choices (emoji intensity, styling preferences) are stored locally on your device.

### Information Processed Temporarily
- **Message Text**: When you tap the enhance button, the text you're currently typing is sent to our AI service provider (OpenAI) for tone analysis. This text is:
  - Processed in real-time
  - NOT stored by ToneType
  - NOT logged or retained
  - Sent only when you explicitly tap the enhance button

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do NOT log keystrokes
- We do NOT store your messages
- We do NOT track what apps you use
- We do NOT collect personal identifying information
- We do NOT use your data for advertising
- We do NOT sell your data to third parties

## How We Use Information

The information we process is used solely to:
1. Analyze the emotional tone of your text
2. Generate appropriate emoji suggestions
3. Apply Unicode text styling
4. Return the enhanced message to you

## Third-Party Services

### OpenAI
When you enhance a message, the text is sent to OpenAI's API for analysis. OpenAI's use of this data is governed by their privacy policy and API terms. Key points:
- OpenAI does not use API data to train their models (as of their current policy)
- Data is transmitted securely via HTTPS
- Data is processed and returned without permanent storage

You can review OpenAI's privacy practices at: https://openai.com/privacy

## Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures:
- All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption
- API keys are stored in iOS Keychain (encrypted)
- No server-side data storage
- No user accounts or authentication required

## Keyboard Permissions

ToneType requires "Full Access" to function. This iOS permission is necessary because:
- Network access is required to reach the AI service
- This permission does NOT give us access to passwords or sensitive fields

**What Full Access Does NOT Do:**
- Does NOT send everything you type
- Does NOT record your keystrokes
- Does NOT access other apps' data
- Does NOT track your location

## Children's Privacy

ToneType is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- **Delete**: Remove the app and all local data is deleted
- **Opt-out**: Use offline mode (no data sent anywhere)
- **Transparency**: Know exactly what data is processed (as described above)

## Data Retention

- **Messages**: Not retained. Processed and immediately discarded.
- **Settings**: Stored locally until you delete the app.
- **API Key**: Stored locally until you remove it or delete the app.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by:
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Showing a notice in the app for significant changes

## Contact Us

## California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have specific rights regarding your personal information under the CCPA. Since we do not sell personal information and collect minimal data, most CCPA provisions do not apply. However, you may contact us for any privacy-related requests.

## International Users

ToneType is operated from the United States. If you are accessing the app from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States.

## Summary

**TL;DR**: ToneType only processes text when you tap enhance. We don't store, log, or sell your messages. Your privacy is fundamental to our product.
