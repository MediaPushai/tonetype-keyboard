ToneType is a keyboard extension that enhances messages with emojis and Unicode styling based on detected emotional tone.

To test:
1. Install the app
2. Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > ToneType
3. Tap ToneType and enable "Allow Full Access"
4. Open Messages or Notes
5. Switch to ToneType keyboard (globe icon)
6. Type a message like "I'm so excited about this!"
7. Tap the enhance button to see enhancement

The keyboard requires Full Access to make network calls to our AI service. No data is stored or logged.

For testing with AI features, the app can work with a user-provided OpenAI API key, or basic offline detection is available.
