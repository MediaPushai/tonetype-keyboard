Stop being misunderstood.

Ever sent a message that was taken the wrong way? "Fine." can mean so many things. ToneType is the keyboard that ensures your messages read exactly how you mean them.

How it works:
1. Type your message in any app
2. Tap the enhance button
3. ToneType analyzes your tone
4. Your message transforms with perfect emojis and styling

Before: "I can't believe you did that"
After: "I can't believe you did that!" with bold emphasis and emojis

Features:

- AI Tone Detection
Our AI understands context, not just keywords. It knows the difference between excited "I can't wait!" and frustrated "I can't wait any longer."

- Smart Emphasis
ToneType identifies which words carry emotional weight and styles them appropriately - bold for anger, italics for sarcasm, and more.

- Context-Aware Emojis
No more scrolling through emoji keyboards. ToneType suggests the perfect emojis based on what you actually mean.

- Unicode Text Styling
Stand out with bold, italic, and stylized text that works everywhere - even in apps that don't support formatting.

- Privacy First
Your messages are only processed when you tap enhance. We never store or log what you type.

- Works Everywhere
Messages, WhatsApp, Instagram, Slack, Email - anywhere you type, ToneType works.

Tone Detection:
- Happy: Cheerful emojis + clean text
- Sad: Gentle emojis + soft styling
- Angry: Bold emphasis + strong emojis
- Excited: Vibrant emojis + energetic styling
- Sarcastic: Subtle emojis + italic text
- Urgent: Bold caps + attention emojis
- And more...

Why ToneType?
Communication is 90% tone, but text has 0% tone built in. ToneType bridges that gap, helping you express yourself authentically in every message.

Setup is easy:
1. Download ToneType
2. Enable in Settings > Keyboards
3. Switch to ToneType when typing
4. Tap the enhance button

Express yourself. Accurately.
