## Launch Announcement Posts

### Twitter/X Launch Thread

**Tweet 1:**
```
Introducing ToneType 🎉

The keyboard that understands your tone.

One tap → AI analyzes your message → adds perfect emojis + styling

No more "why do you sound mad?" texts 😤

Free to download →
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Here's how it works:

1️⃣ Type your message
2️⃣ Tap ✨
3️⃣ ToneType detects your tone
4️⃣ Adds the right emojis + emphasis

Before: "I need this done"
After: "I 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 this done ⚠️"

Your tone, understood.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
We detect:
• Happy 😊
• Sad 😢
• Angry 😤
• Excited 🚀
• Sarcastic 😏
• Urgent ⚠️

And the AI identifies WHICH words to emphasize based on context, not guessing.

"I can't believe YOU did that" → different from
"I can't believe you did THAT"
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Privacy is not negotiable.

✅ Messages only sent when you tap enhance
✅ Never stored
✅ Never logged
✅ Never sold

We built ToneType to help you communicate, not to harvest your data.
```

**Tweet 5:**

Works in EVERY app:
• Messages

### LinkedIn Launch Post

```
Excited to announce the launch of ToneType.

We've all been there: you send a perfectly reasonable message, and somehow it's interpreted as passive-aggressive. Or your genuine excitement reads as sarcasm.

Text lacks tone, and that gap causes real communication problems—especially in remote work environments where 90% of conversations happen through text.

ToneType is an AI-powered keyboard that:
• Analyzes the emotional context of your message
• Identifies which words carry emphasis
• Adds appropriate emojis and text styling

The result? Messages that read the way you mean them.

Privacy-first approach: we only process text when you explicitly tap the enhance button. Nothing is stored or logged.

Available now for iOS. Android coming soon.
