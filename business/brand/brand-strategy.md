# ToneType Brand Strategy

## Brand Positioning

### The Problem
Text messages lack emotional context. "Fine." can mean acceptance, frustration, or passive aggression. Recipients misinterpret tone, leading to unnecessary conflict and communication breakdowns.

### The Solution
ToneType is a keyboard that understands what you mean—not just what you type. It analyzes emotional context and enhances messages with appropriate emojis and Unicode styling, ensuring your true tone comes through.

### Positioning Statement
For people who communicate through text, ToneType is the keyboard that ensures your tone is understood. Unlike standard keyboards that leave interpretation to chance, ToneType uses AI to detect emotional context and enhance messages with the right emojis and styling—so "fine" reads the way you mean it.

### Tagline Options
- **Primary**: "Say it like you mean it."
- **Alternative 1**: "Your tone, understood."
- **Alternative 2**: "Express yourself, accurately."
