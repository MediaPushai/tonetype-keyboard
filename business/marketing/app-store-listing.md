### Full Description

**Stop being misunderstood.**

Ever sent a message that was taken the wrong way? "Fine." can mean so many things. ToneType is the keyboard that ensures your messages read exactly how you mean them.

**How it works:**
1. Type your message in any app
2. Tap the ✨ enhance button
3. ToneType analyzes your tone
4. Your message transforms with perfect emojis and styling

**Before:** "I can't believe you did that"
**After:** "𝗜 𝗰𝗮𝗻'𝘁 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 you did that! 😤"

**Features:**

✨ **AI Tone Detection**
Our AI understands context, not just keywords. It knows the difference between excited "I can't wait!" and frustrated "I can't wait any longer."

🎯 **Smart Emphasis**
ToneType identifies which words carry emotional weight and styles them appropriately—bold for anger, italics for sarcasm, and more.

😊 **Context-Aware Emojis**
No more scrolling through emoji keyboards. ToneType suggests the perfect emojis based on what you actually mean.

🔤 **Unicode Text Styling**
Stand out with bold, italic, and stylized text that works everywhere—even in apps that don't support formatting.

🔒 **Privacy First**
Your messages are only processed when you tap enhance. We never store or log what you type.

⚡ **Works Everywhere**
Messages, WhatsApp, Instagram, Slack, Email—anywhere you type, ToneType works.

**Tone Detection:**
• Happy → Cheerful emojis + clean text
• Sad → Gentle emojis + soft styling
• Angry → Bold emphasis + strong emojis
• Excited → Vibrant emojis + energetic styling
• Sarcastic → Subtle emojis + italic text
• Urgent → Bold caps + attention emojis
• And more...

**Why ToneType?**
Communication is 90% tone, but text has 0% tone built in. ToneType bridges that gap, helping you express yourself authentically in every message.

**Setup is easy:**
1. Download ToneType
2. Enable in Settings → Keyboards
3. Switch to ToneType when typing
4. Tap ✨ to enhance

Express yourself. Accurately.
