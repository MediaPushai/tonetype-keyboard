## The Story

Text messaging has become our primary mode of communication, but it's fundamentally flawed: text has no tone. The same message—"Fine."—can express agreement, frustration, or passive aggression depending on context that simply doesn't exist in text.

ToneType was born from a simple frustration: too many perfectly good conversations derailed by misinterpreted tone. We built an AI keyboard that understands not just what you're typing, but how you mean it—then enhances your message with the right emojis and styling to ensure you're understood.

## Key Facts

- **First keyboard to use AI for real-time emotional context analysis**
- **Detects 8+ emotional tones** (happy, sad, angry, excited, sarcastic, urgent, formal, casual)
- **AI-determined emphasis**: Unlike keyword matching, ToneType understands which words carry emotional weight in context
- **Works universally**: Functions in any app—Messages, WhatsApp, Instagram, Slack, email
- **Privacy-first**: Messages only processed when user taps enhance; nothing stored or logged

## Product Features

### AI Tone Detection
ToneType's AI analyzes the emotional context of your message, understanding nuance that keyword-based systems miss. "I can't wait" in the context of anticipation reads differently than frustration—ToneType knows the difference.

### Smart Emphasis
The AI identifies which specific words carry emotional weight. "I can't believe YOU did that" has different emphasis than "I can't believe you did THAT"—and ToneType styles them accordingly.

### Context-Aware Emojis
No more scrolling through emoji keyboards. Based on detected tone and context, ToneType suggests emojis that match your intended meaning.

### Unicode Text Styling
ToneType applies bold, italic, and other Unicode text styles that work everywhere—even in apps that don't support rich text formatting.

---

## How It Works

1. User types message in any app
2. User taps the ✨ enhance button
3. ToneType AI analyzes emotional context
4. Message is enhanced with appropriate emojis and styling
5. User reviews and sends

**Example:**
- Before: "I can't believe you actually did that"
- After: "I **can't believe** you actually did that! 😲✨"

## Founder Quote

"We've all sent a message that was taken the wrong way. A study found that up to 50% of emotional intent is misinterpreted in text. ToneType exists to close that gap—to help people communicate what they actually mean, not just what they type."

## FAQ for Press

**Q: How is ToneType different from Grammarly or other writing tools?**
A: Grammarly focuses on grammar and clarity. ToneType focuses on emotional tone—understanding how your message will be perceived emotionally and enhancing it with emojis and styling to match your intent.

**Q: Does ToneType read everything I type?**
A: No. ToneType only analyzes text when you tap the enhance button. We never log keystrokes, store messages, or monitor typing.

**Q: Why does ToneType need "Full Access" on iOS?**
A: iOS requires Full Access for keyboard extensions to make network calls. This permission does NOT give us access to passwords or sensitive fields, and we don't use it to monitor typing—only to process text when you explicitly tap enhance.

**Q: Is ToneType free?**
A: Yes. The free tier includes 10 enhancements per day. Pro users get unlimited enhancements for $4.99/month.

**Q: What AI does ToneType use?**
A: ToneType uses OpenAI's language models for tone analysis. Users can also provide their own API key for unlimited usage.
